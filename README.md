# gorditos-community-spa-react

"Gorditos Community" SPA is a website for "gorditos" (people who share the love for food!) to meet and have access to other registered users who share the same interest. Users can register in the website and have access to other users data. It consumes data from "Delilah Resto API". Mini project for React practice (DESKTOP version). 

STEPS:

1) First, make sure the backend (Delilah Resto API) is working properly. To do this, head to "https://github.com/mariacristinatovarsalas/delilah-resto-back" and follow the instructions in its READ.md

2) Open GitBash in the folder where you want to save the project. Write "git clone" followed by the link of the project 

3) From Visual Studio Code (code editor) open terminal and write "npm install", wait for the process to be completed and then write "npm start".
