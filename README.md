# gorditos-community-spa-react

"Gorditos Community" SPA is a website for "gorditos" (people who share the love for food!) to meet and have access to other registered users who share the same interest. Users can register in the website and have access to other users data. It consumes data from "Delilah Resto APP". FRONTEND: HTML5, CSS3, React.JS (DESKTOP version). Project in progress.

STEPS:

1) First, make sure the backend (Delilah Cristina Resto APP) is working properly. To do this, head to "https://github.com/mariacristinatovarsalas/app-delilah-cristina-resto" and follow the instructions in its README.md

2) Open GitBash in the folder where you want to save the project. Write "git clone" followed by the link of the project. 

3) From Visual Studio Code (code editor) open terminal and write "npm install", wait for the process to be completed and then write "npm start" command.
